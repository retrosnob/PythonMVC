Need to be able to 

push and pop moves
evaluate the board
see whose move it is
get all legal moves

We don't want to duplicate functions that are already defined in the model.
Perhaps we abstract shared functions out into a separate class. Otherwise
we pass the cpuplayer's representation of the board back to the model for 
evaluation, etc.

        Args:
            grid (List): The current position as a 5x5 list with 1 or 2 for player pieces
            or 0 for empty.
            turn (Int): The player from whose pov to calculate the evaluation. A good 
            evaluation is positive for this player.


        Returns:
            float: The evaluation.
            
        There are two options here. We can always evaluate the position from the pov of the 
        maximising player by using an instance variable that never changes, or we can pass
        in the player from whose pov to evaluate the position. If the player passed in is
        always the maximising player, then these are equivalent. Alternatively, we could call
        this function with the player whose turn it is, whether or not they are the maximising
        player, and negate it if they aren't.
        
        In this implementation, we always pass in the maximising player, not the player whose
        turn it is.
        
        The function uses a table to calculate scores for piece positions as a way of preferring
        centralisation of the pieces. Other than that, if there is a result on the horizon,
        the static evaluations will dominate.
