Need to be able to 

push and pop moves
evaluate the board
see whose move it is
get all legal moves

We don't want to duplicate functions that are already defined in the model.
Perhaps we abstract shared functions out into a separate class. Otherwise
we pass the cpuplayer's representation of the board back to the model for 
evaluation, etc.
